    <h3>Hey Peeps !</h3>
    <p> Welcome to my personal website, where I share my passion for ‚öõÔ∏è science and boredom.ü•±</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I'm a physicist and DIY aficionado who loves to create. I'm passionate about using my knowledge of physics and electronics to build 
        new and innovative things. I also enjoy sharing my skills and knowledge with others.</p>
        <p>‚ö†Ô∏è <i>On this website, you'll find a variety of boring stuff related to my interests,</i>  </p>
        <p></p>
<p>üöÄ<b>DIY projects: </b>I love to build all sorts of things, from robots to smart home devices. I share my projects and tutorials here on my blog.</p>
    
<p>‚ö° <b>Electronics: </b>I'm fascinated by how electronics work, and I love to learn new things about them, as well as through my work on various DIY projects.</p>
<p>üëæ <b>Coding: </b>I'm relatively new to coding, but I'm learning as much as I can. I use coding to power some of my DIY projects, especially in embedded systems</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm always exploring new ideas and learning new things. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate.</p>
